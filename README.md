# Dirtr

## Abstract
  - Dirtr is an application which simulates users, allows you to take control of a user account, and utilize an app to find/favorite offroading trails in Colorado. This project is our final group project at Turing, working alongside backenders to make a truly from-scratch full-stack app. This is purely the Front End repo.

### Learning Goals
- Work on a fullstack team

- Independently learn and integrate Redux and CircleCI into the app
